3. **Read** - Read actively, taking notes
4. **Recite** - Summarize in your own words
5. **Review** - Review notes before next session

**For Code Examples:**

```
1. Read the example first
2. Try to predict the output
3. Type it out yourself (don't copy-paste)
4. Modify and experiment
5. Apply to your project
```
